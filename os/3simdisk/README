1.how to compile simdisk?
You can just type make in the source code directory to compile code

2.how to run simdisk?
After you compiled the source code, you can just type ./simdisk to run

3.how to use options?

OPTIONS:
−h : Print a usage summary with all options and exit.
−n number-of-cylinders : Set the total number cylinders on the disk. By default it should be 200.
(Be careful that disk cylinder indexes would be between 0-199 in this
case.)
− d disk-shed-policy : Set the disk scheduling policy. It can be either FCFS (First-come-firstserved),
SSTF (Shortest-seek-time-first), C-SCAN, or LOOK. The
default will be FCFS. Assume at the t=t0, the disk head was moving
from 0 towards other end of the disk (i.e. cylinder n).
−i input file : Read the I/O request sequence from a specified file. If not given,the sequence should
be read from STDIN (ended with ENTER).

you can use ./simdisk -n 100 -d SSTF -i my_inputfile to run simdisk
You can also just input some arguments like ./simdisk -n 100 -d SSTF, this way you should use stdin to input request sequence.
Note:when you use stdin to input request sequence, make sure that the first number is the total number of requests.
For example, when you just type ./simdisk, you should input the request sequence. It may like this 6 1 9 2 3 8 7.
The first number 6 is the total number of request
